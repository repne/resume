#### Me ####

Hi, my name is Antonio Fiumanò, I was born in Italy in October 1, 1985, I'm a **developer** in a wide variety of applications but my *current* focus is on web applications and services because designing and building scalable, distributed applications on the cloud is challenging and challenge is *fun!*

Although I have **10 years of professional experience**, I have never worked a single day of my life.
I *love* programming, I've been programming since I was 9 years old, it's my passion and my stress relief, my obsession and my hobby.
That's why I'm looking for a dynamic and young environment with passionate people like me, people I could learn from.

### Professional Experience ###

#### 1E ####
2014-

Currently working on a cloud based virtualization solution for implementing "Bring Your Own Device" policies. I've been developing on the **Azure** backend using **C#** and on the virtualization engine in **C++** for low level or high performance functionalities (encryption, drivers, compression, etc...).

#### JustGiving ####
2013 - 2014

Worked on the new mobile focused donation process and the new universal search. My work improved the conversion rate and the performance of the website by a considerable amount. I spent the rest of my time teaching people new skills and improving the development/release cycle of the platform.

#### DocFlow ####
2012 - 2013

My job as a Software Architect was to introduce agile methodologies, coordinate two teams of developers, refactoring & redesigning the internal web platform, architect and lead developer of the most strategically important project of the company. I was working both on the backend (**C#**) and the frontend (**HTML5**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **KnockoutJs**, **AmplifyJs**, **Bootstrap**) developing mostly the frontend part while reviewing, designing and gluing together the backend.

#### Yoox ####
2010 - 2012

My job consisted mainly in **SoA** and **web APIs** design on the **Microsoft stack**, I was in charge of architecting and developing **distributed** applications using micro services in **C#** on the **.net Framework**, successfully handling millions of requests per hour.
Scrum was part of my daily routine but I'm used to XP and KanBan too.
I approached software development mostly with **TDD** and **BDD**, always in continuous integration.

#### Expert System ####
2004 - 2010

This job introduced me to **Semantics and Linguistics** and still today **Natural Language Processing** along with **Information Retrieval** are two of my main interests.
I've successfully delivered a wide range of server and client applications for the **Windows** and **Linux** platforms using mostly  **C++**, **MFC**, **boost** and later **C#**.
My love for algorithms and data structures plus my obsessive perfectionism pushed me to come up with my own take on prefix trees for fast dictionary lookup.

#### Milo ####
2003 - 2004

My first job at the age of 17 had me involved as the **developer** of a **real time debugger** for microcontrollers (USB, RS-232, GPS tracking system) using **C** and **C++**.

### Personal Experience ###

#### 2014 - ####

Currently researching and studying Machine Learning problems, specifically Recurrent Neural Network, closely following  recent developments and publications (the work of Hinton and Sutskever in particular, those guys are my heroes).

#### 2013 - 2014 ####

I wrote a kernel driver (**KMDF**, **HID**, **USB**) in **C** for Windows 8.1 in order to implement a multi touch functionality (with gestures) for my MacBook Pro because the Apple driver for Windows is extremely basic and lacking. I've also been writing small single page web apps using **AngularJS**.

#### 2012 - 2013 ####

I took a long break from the computers this summer and picked up many sports like sailing and cycling (I bought a bicycle and travelled from Milan, Italy to Santander, Spain in 20 days, 1842 Km -_-). But I've also been experimenting with the new Windows 8 metro style apps (**Javascript**, **CSS**, **HTML5**), studying **Redis** source code (I had this crazy idea about a Linux kernel module that miserably failed) and increased my knowledge about UX and UI design.

#### 2011 - 2012 ####

I spent nights working on web apps that used technologies such as **Tornado**, **Node.js**, **Redis**, **MongoDB**, **RabbitMQ** and **Memcached** running (mainly) on **Amazon AWS**.
I've moved away from **AppEngine** after 2 years of experience.
In the choice of a stack I opted to have as many movable parts as possible, the more heterogeneous the better; this is usually a mistake for production applications but my choice was based on the fact that there is a lot to learn this way, and learning is *fun!*

#### 2004 - 2011 ####

Meanwhile in My-Spare-Time my focus shifted forth and back between **games development**, **script languages implementations** and **drivers development** (Linux and Windows, 3Dfx Glide, mesa/dri) but in **2008** I refreshed my **HTML** skills and finally settled on web development.
My interest about the web introduced me to **PHP** and **Javascript** in the early days of DHTML, but the languages of choice this time were **C#** (ASP.net, ASP.net MVC) because I knew it and **Python** (AppEngine, Django) because I fell in love with it.

#### 1994 - 2004 ####

The first line of code I've written was in **BASIC** and after a few years of experimentation with different languages I moved to **C** and then **ASM** because I wanted to develop my own operating system (monolithic kernel, single-threaded, bootloader and a basic filesystem), later I switched to **C++** because I felt it was more suited for writing **3D game engines**, I worked for a year using **DirectX** then moved to **OpenGL**.
But writing a 3D game is a huge task for a single person and I got lost when rolling my own script language (stack-based VM, event driven, C like syntax, configurable EBNF grammar) using, of course, **boost::spirit**.
