#### Me ####

Hello, my name is Antonio Fiuman√≤, I was born in Italy in October 1, 1985, I'm a **software architect** and **developer** in a wide variety of applications but my *current* focus is on web applications because designing and building scalable, distributed applications on the cloud is challenging and challenge is *fun!*

Although I have **10 years' of professional experience**, I have never worked a single day of my life.
I *love* programming, heck, I've been programming since I was 9 years old, it's my passion and my stress reliever, my obsession and my hobby.
That's why I'm looking for a dynamic and young environment with people passionate like me, people I could learn from.

#### Job 4 ####

I moved to London to work with (<abbr title="JustGiving, London, United Kingdom">JustGiving, 2013-</abbr>) on the new mobile focused donation process and the new universal elastic search. My work improved the conversion rate and the performance of the website by a considerable amount. I spent the rest of my time teaching people new skills and improving the development/release cycle of the platform.

#### 2012-2013 ####
I took a long break from the computers this summer and picked up many sports like sailing and cycling (I bought a bicycle and travelled from Milan, Italy to Santander, Spain in 20 days, 1842 Km -_-). But I've also been experimenting with the new Windows 8 metro style apps (**Javascript**, **CSS**, **HTML5**), studying **Redis** source code (I had this crazy idea about a Linux kernel module that miserably failed) and increased my knowledge about UX and UI design.

#### Job 3 ####

Moving to Milan for a Software Architect position (<abbr title="DocFlow S.p.a., Milano, Italy">DocFlow, 2012-2013</abbr>) has been a great challenge. My job was to introduce agile methodologies, coordinate two teams of developers, refactoring & redesigning the whole web platform of the company, architect and lead developer of the most strategically important project of the company. As an architect, I was working both on the backend (**C#**) and the frontend (**HTML5**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **KnockoutJs**, **AmplifyJs**, **Bootstrap**) developing mostly the frontend part while reviewing, designing and gluing together the backend part.

#### 2011-2012 ####

I spent nights working on web apps that used technologies such as **Tornado**, **Node.js**, **Redis**, **MongoDB**, **RabbitMQ** and **Memcached** running (mainly) on **Amazon AWS**.
I've moved away from **AppEngine** after 2 years of experience.
In the choice of a stack I opted to have as many movable parts as possible, the more heterogeneous the better; this is usually a mistake for production applications but my choice was based on the fact that there is a lot to learn this way, and learning is *fun!*

#### Job 2 ####

Web development slowly became my hobby and I started with my first web developer position (<abbr title="Yoox S.p.a., Bologna, Italy">Yoox, 2010-2012</abbr>) in January 2010.
My job consisted mainly in **SoA** and **web APIs** design on the **Microsoft stack** <dfn>(ASP.net MVC, C#)</dfn>, I was in charge of architecting and developing **distributed** applications in **C#** on the **.net Framework** that are successfully handling millions of requests per hour.
Scrum was part of my daily routine but I'm used to XP and KanBan too.
I approached software development mainly with **<acronym title="Test Driven Development">TDD</acronym>** and **<acronym title="Behavior Driven Development">BDD</acronym>**, always in continuous integration.

#### 2004-2011 ####

Meanwhile in My-Spare-Time my focus shifted forth and back between **games development**, **script languages implementations** and **drivers development** (Linux and Windows, 3Dfx Glide, mesa/dri) but in **2008** I refreshed my **HTML** skills and finally settled on web development.
My interest about the web introduced me to **PHP** and **Javascript** in the early days of DHTML, but the languages of choice this time were **C#** <dfn>(ASP.net, ASP.net MVC)</dfn> because I knew it and **Python** <dfn>(AppEngine, Django)</dfn> because I fell in love with it.

#### Job 1 ####

Then I got my second job (<abbr title="Expert System S.p.a., Modena, Italy">Expert System, 2004-2010</abbr>), which introduced me to **Semantics and Linguistics**.
Still today **Natural Language Processing** along with **Information Retrieval** are two of my interests.
I've successfully delivered a wide range of server and client applications for the **Windows** and **Linux** platforms using mainly **C++**, **MFC**, **boost** and later **C#**.
My love for algorithms and data structures plus my obsessive perfectionism pushed me to came up with my own take on prefix trees for fast dictionary lookup.

#### Job 0 ####

My first job (<abbr title="Milo S.a.s, Modena, Italy">Milo, 2003-2004</abbr>) at the age of 17 had me involved as the **lead developer** of a **real time debugger** for microcontrollers <dfn>(USB, RS-232, GPS tracking system)</dfn> using **C** and **C++**.

#### 1994-2004 ####

The first line of code I've written was in **BASIC** and after a few years of experimentation with different languages I moved to **C** and then **ASM** because I wanted to develop my own operating system <dfn>(monolithic kernel, single-threaded, bootloader and a basic filesystem)</dfn>, later I switched to **C++** because I felt it was more suited for writing **3D game engines**, I worked for a year using **DirectX** then moved to **OpenGL**.
But writing a 3D game is a huge task for a single person and I got lost when rolling my own script language <dfn>(stack-based VM, event driven, C like syntax, configurable EBNF grammar)</dfn> using, of course, **boost::spirit**.
