#### Me ####

Hi, my name is Antonio Fiumanò, I was born in Italy in October 1, 1985, I'm a **developer** in a wide variety of applications but my *current* focus is on web applications and services because designing and building scalable, distributed applications on the cloud is challenging and challenge is *fun!*

Although I have **12 years of professional experience**, I have never worked a single day of my life.
I *love* programming, heck, I've been programming since I was 9 years old, it's my passion and my stress relief, my obsession and my hobby.
That's why I'm looking for a dynamic and young environment with passionate people like me, people I could learn from.

### Professional Experience ###

#### Mailcloud ####

I've developed applications on the Microsoft Azure stack, using Service Fabric, Orleans, Cloud Services, Storage Services (Tables, Queues, Blobs), Service Bus...

I've implemented core algorithms for data sharding, conflict free replicated data types, load balancing and data streaming with strong eventual consistency.

#### 1E ####

I've worked on a cloud based virtual machine delivery solution for implementing "Bring Your Own Device" policies. I've been developing on the **Azure** backend using **C#** and the virtualization engine in **C++** for low level or high performance functionalities (encryption, drivers, compression, etc...).

#### JustGiving ####

I moved to London to work with (<abbr title="JustGiving, London, United Kingdom">JustGiving, 2013-</abbr>) on the new mobile focused donation process and the new universal search. My work improved the conversion rate and the performance of the website by a considerable amount. I spent the rest of my time teaching people new skills and improving the development/release cycle of the platform.

#### DocFlow ####

Moving to Milan for a Software Architect position (<abbr title="DocFlow S.p.a., Milano, Italy">DocFlow, 2012-2013</abbr>) has been a great challenge. My job was to introduce agile methodologies, coordinate two teams of developers, refactoring & redesigning the whole web platform of the company, architect and lead developer of the most strategically important project of the company. As an architect, I was working both on the backend (**C#**) and the frontend (**HTML5**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **KnockoutJs**, **AmplifyJs**, **Bootstrap**) developing mostly the frontend part while reviewing, designing and gluing together the backend part.

#### Yoox ####

Web development slowly became my hobby and I started with my first web developer position (<abbr title="Yoox S.p.a., Bologna, Italy">Yoox, 2010-2012</abbr>) in January 2010.
My job consisted mainly in **SoA** and **web APIs** design on the **Microsoft stack** <dfn>(ASP.net MVC, C#)</dfn>, I was in charge of architecting and developing **distributed** applications in **C#** on the **.net Framework** that are successfully handling millions of requests per hour.
Scrum was part of my daily routine but I'm used to XP and KanBan too.
I approached software development mainly with **<acronym title="Test Driven Development">TDD</acronym>** and **<acronym title="Behavior Driven Development">BDD</acronym>**, always in continuous integration.

#### Expert System ####

Then I got my second job (<abbr title="Expert System S.p.a., Modena, Italy">Expert System, 2004-2010</abbr>), which introduced me to **Semantics and Linguistics**.
Still today **Natural Language Processing** along with **Information Retrieval** are two of my interests.
I've successfully delivered a wide range of server and client applications for the **Windows** and **Linux** platforms using mainly **C++**, **MFC**, **boost** and later **C#**.
My love for algorithms and data structures plus my obsessive perfectionism pushed me to came up with my own take on prefix trees for fast dictionary lookup.

#### Milo ####

My first job (<abbr title="Milo S.a.s, Modena, Italy">Milo, 2003-2004</abbr>) at the age of 17 had me involved as the **developer** of a **real time debugger** for microcontrollers <dfn>(USB, RS-232, GPS tracking system)</dfn> using **C** and **C++**.

### Personal Experience ###

#### 2014 - 2016 ####

I've built on a mobile app using **React Native**, handling backend calls on Azure using **Microsoft Orleans**, a distributed actor framework, and sharding data based on geo location using a geohash algorithm.

Currently researching and studying Machine Learning problems, specifically Recurrent Neural Network, closely following  recent developments  and publications (the work of Hinton and Sutskever in particular).

#### 2013-2014 ####

I wrote a kernel driver (**KMDF**, **HID**, **USB**) in **C** for Windows 8.1 in order to implement a multi touch functionality (with gestures) for my MacBook Pro because the Apple driver for Windows is extremely basic and lacking. I've also been writing small single page web apps using **AngularJS**.

#### 2012-2013 ####

I took a long break from the computers this summer and picked up many sports like sailing and cycling (I bought a bicycle and travelled from Milan, Italy to Santander, Spain in 20 days, 1842 Km -_-). But I've also been experimenting with the new Windows 8 metro style apps (**Javascript**, **CSS**, **HTML5**), studying **Redis** source code (I had this crazy idea about a Linux kernel module that miserably failed) and increased my knowledge about UX and UI design.

#### 2011-2012 ####

I spent nights working on web apps that used technologies such as **Tornado**, **Node.js**, **Redis**, **MongoDB**, **RabbitMQ** and **Memcached** running (mainly) on **Amazon AWS**.
I've moved away from **AppEngine** after 2 years of experience.
In the choice of a stack I opted to have as many movable parts as possible, the more heterogeneous the better; this is usually a mistake for production applications but my choice was based on the fact that there is a lot to learn this way, and learning is *fun!*

#### 2004-2011 ####

Meanwhile in My-Spare-Time my focus shifted forth and back between **games development**, **script languages implementations** and **drivers development** (Linux and Windows, 3Dfx Glide, mesa/dri) but in **2008** I refreshed my **HTML** skills and finally settled on web development.
My interest about the web introduced me to **PHP** and **Javascript** in the early days of DHTML, but the languages of choice this time were **C#** <dfn>(ASP.net, ASP.net MVC)</dfn> because I knew it and **Python** <dfn>(AppEngine, Django)</dfn> because I fell in love with it.

#### 1994-2004 ####

The first line of code I've written was in **BASIC** and after a few years of experimentation with different languages I moved to **C** and then **ASM** because I wanted to develop my own operating system <dfn>(monolithic kernel, single-threaded, bootloader and a basic filesystem)</dfn>, later I switched to **C++** because I felt it was more suited for writing **3D game engines**, I worked for a year using **DirectX** then moved to **OpenGL**.
But writing a 3D game is a huge task for a single person and I got lost when rolling my own script language <dfn>(stack-based VM, event driven, C like syntax, configurable EBNF grammar)</dfn> using, of course, **boost::spirit**.
